# rowscript-core

RowScript core theory.

* Presyntax: The *ROSE* language from paper
* Syntax: The *system F-star-plus* from paper

## Some conventions

* About comments, some constructs already mentioned in the paper would not be documented, unless we make some changes on
  them
* Terms would be directly imported without namespaces, like `Unit`, but other constructs like types/schemes should be
  explicitly referenced with their namespaces, like `Type::Unit`, because term introduction looks more natural
